Wireless drivers also seem to be very complex. Esp the modern Wifi6 + BT5 ones. Intel AX200 for example, almost impossible to reverse engineer well

## Why so complex?
Frequencies, bands, synchonising send and receive. Other functionality like location retrieval, find my device, automatic frequency bands. DHCP and stuff.
I actually dk, I dont think it should be that complex.
