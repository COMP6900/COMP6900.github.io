## Inconsistent GUI

Windows and Linux esp. BSDs and Macos dont have this problem and are usually more consistent. BSDs dont even come with graphical environments most of the time, just a console. </br>

For windows, just LOL.<br/>
For linux, well look gnome and kde aren't too bad.<br/>

They work. But they could be better. KDE esp, so much promise i see. But damn the extra titlebar is like 90% of my complaints. Also the fact that linux graphics drivers are like low tier trash, even amd crashes frequently for me. IDK bro. I think they need some kind of wake up call.

## BIOS and Low level graphics

What?? They look like utter trash. Bootloader should be loading the graphics drivers off the bat to make it look as less shoddy as possible. TY.

## Software Suite

Windows and Macos do it quite well. Windows is like actually pretty good in this regard, but can def do much better. Linux... Look if you want to use libreoffice then go for it. But I rather use something that doesnt look like it was made in the 90s.
