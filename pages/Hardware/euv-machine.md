## Sn Plasma

What we do is we liquify tin, which should be liquid at room temp anyway. Then we make very small droplets into a CO2 laser. Which then ionises the Sn since the photons generated are at least 709J and less than 1411J.

### CO2 Laser

The CO2 laser is produced by a CO2 gas chamber. Electricity at x V is run through it, exciting them to level n and producing 700-1400J photons (>4.4e21 eV). That are then forced out of the tube (which is made of a clear glass that is quite inert).

These photons then excite the electrons of Tin atoms. It is the Tin electron relaxation from plasma state to ground state (quite a high energy difference) that creates high energy EUV photons, since the plasma electrons want to return to a low energy level discretely.

### 2 Lasers

Actually there are two lasers. The first laser is simply hot enough to vaporise the Sn liquid droplets to gaseous state of low density. Then the second laser pumps enough energy into the system to create plasma by ionising the gas atoms.
