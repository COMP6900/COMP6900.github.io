## Exynos 990

A samsung soc. Apparently not great compared to its qualcomm rival. But in my experience, good enough. Kinda meh battery life and may get hot over long use esp. video. Music and general browsing is pretty good.

### CPU

- 2x Exynos M5 (High Power)
- 2x Cortex-A76 (Med)
- 4x Cortex-A55 (High Efficiency)

Each core has:

- 192KB L1

with:

- 1MB L2, 2MB L3

TDP => 9W. So not a lot of power consumption available.

### Mali GPU

Mali-G77 MP11 by ARM. On the 'Valhall' microarch.

- 11 execution units
- 176 shading units

Supports Vulkan 1.1. Though latest is 1.3
