## Antennas

The antennas are located in the card itself.

- Antennas of all wireless card should be the exact same length. This allows best synchronisation for incoming photons at radio freq
- These waves can and do interfere constructively and destructively. This is bad 

## Theory

- Wifi signals are radio waves. So they usually have a freq of 2.4-5GHz. This is between 12cm-6cm, and readily travels through things since the energy of the photons dont have enough energy to raise the electrons to a higher level. Nor the protons. So the photons usually just pass through without transferring its energy to the electrons.
- If the energy is too high, like a gamma photon, then it can knock an electron completely out. Technically gamma radiation has the lowest penetration in terms of electromagnetic radiation. But nuclear radiation is a different story.
