Rei is a human-centric language for building systems and applications. As such it comes with a larger standard library, package management and building semantics, simplified and clean syntax without "junk".

## Programming Languages

Tbh I dont really know much about how languages are designed and built. I know a bit about parsers, semantic analysis, assembly and assemblers and some executable formats like ELF. But Idk about LL(1), LR(1), parse trees/abstract parse trees, EBNF, priority of regex and tokens.

So i'll just put some stuff here as I go. Will be mostly from first principles of the maths
