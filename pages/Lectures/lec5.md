## The truth I should've learned in school

I hate collectivism. Especially half assed ones that try to pretend to endorse freedom.

Note, this doesnt necessarily mean I hate ideologies associated with it. But in general and in practice. If you want a collectivist society, you must go all the way. It is an end, not a means.

But we always talk about means here. For the end is never truly in sight.

## The moment you collectivise

The moment you collectivise, the moment you lose. That is all.
I have spent 2 decades of my early life fighting against it. It really struck my soul. Like an arrow forged in the infernos of the underworld, coated with the finest arsenic.

Once it hits you, you spend a long time trying to get it out. Then recovering from it. There are no easy steps in doing so. And hence the young who are cursed from it must be cured at all costs.

## Why stop being collectivistic?

So you will stop complaining about collectivist problems. Which 99% of the sociopolitical stuff nowadays are about.
