## Overview

I hate collectivism.

Note, this doesnt necessarily mean I hate ideologies associated with it. But in general and in practice. If you want a collectivist society, you either have to go full in or not. It is an end, not a means. We always talk about means here.

## Collectivism

Collectivism does not spread like cancer. It is cancer.

The moment you collectivise, the moment you lose. That is all. The old are very prone to collectivisation, which is very concerning.

Again, I have no qualms against the elderly. But I keep noticing all the bad things stemming from them. Is it a coincidence? Well if you're not a collectivist, you should be able to answer that for yourself.

I have spent 2 decades of my early life fighting against it. It really struck my soul. Like an arrow forged in the infernos of the underworld, coated with the finest arsenic.

Once it hits you, you spend a long time trying to get it out. Then recovering from it. There are no easy steps in doing so. And hence the young who are cursed from it must be cured at all costs.

## Why you need to stop being collectivistic

So you will stop complaining about collectivist problems.
