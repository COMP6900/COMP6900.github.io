## Microcontrollers = Smallest things with software dynamically programmed
Yes. IF you want to flash a new software img, theres usually some small ROM which you can upload to tell it exactly what to do when it starts. i.e. `control` line flashes on a clock edge. What to do? Well for sure it will know.
Usually not that complex, and cant be anyway since ROM is so small.
