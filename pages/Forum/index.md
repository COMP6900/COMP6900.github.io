## Forums
General, Technical, etc. threads are for you to ask any question. You need to authorise your github account with utterances, its quite easy when it prompts you. Just try not to ask a question thats already been asked or can be searched with the site's search function. I recommend using the [General Thread](General/index.md) for most cases.

## Discord
Join the [discord](https://discord.gg/8ZpPu5A6) to ask stuff whenever. Im like asleep in the afternoon so dont bother me then.
