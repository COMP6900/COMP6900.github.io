## Forums
General, Technical, etc. threads are for you to ask any question. Just try not to ask a question thats already been asked or can be searched with the site's search function. I recommend using the [General Thread](General/index.md) for most cases.

## Discord
Join the [discord](https://discord.gg/8ZpPu5A6) to ask stuff whenever. Im like asleep in the afternoon so dont bother me then.
