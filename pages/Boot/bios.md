## What is the BIOS?

BIOS = Basic I/O System

Normally, when I talk about BIOS, I mean 'the firmware embedded into the main board of the computer'. It is the first thing that is loaded into RAM and executed by the processor.

- BIOS can also refer to old 'MBR' schemes

## BIOS Firmware

The firmware is usually stored in an EPROM or SRAM soldered on to the board.

- About ~100MBs in size
