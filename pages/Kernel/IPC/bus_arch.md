## Why Bus?
Unlike X11 and other 'random network systems', you have only one place where you send and extract info. A nice comm line of sorts. Simple, efficient and very cool. I like buses.

## Why not bus?
So you see, there is literally no reason to not do a bus. Like if you like X11 so much, then write an implementation of it yourself and see how well that works. I havent yet, I can, but I still feel like Im getting ripped off if I do.
