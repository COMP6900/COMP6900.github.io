<h1>This is the greatest course of all time.</h1>

<h2>RISC-V</h2>
99% of the stuff here will as if we are talking about an OS built on RISCV64GC. 64GC means the extensions that are useful and ratified.
Technically includes double prec floats and 128bit ints, but I doubt we'll need them for another 5 years.

<h2>Neutron</h2>
Im not really fond of other OSes. So in COMP6900 you will learn how an OS works from the ground up, with a kernel called
Neutron. I actually havent finished it yet. But basically most of the assignments and exercises will be stuff on Neutron.
I have been so kind to take out the modules from it so you can implement it yourself to see how it works.

<h2>Dictator</h2>
The dictator in charge is Jason Qin. He is such a great guy. If you have any questions, ask on the <a href="https://comp6900.github.io/pages/Forum">forums</a>.

Course outline is in <a href="https://comp6900.github.io/pages/Lectures/lec1.html">here</a>.
