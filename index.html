<h1>This is the greatest course of all time.</h1>

<h2>RISC-V</h2>
99% of the stuff here will as if we are talking about an OS built on RISCV64GC. 64GC means the extensions that are useful and ratified. Technically includes double prec floats and
128bit ints, but I doubt we'll need them for another 5 years.

<h2>Dictator</h2>
The dictator in charge is Jason Qin. He is such a great guy. He has a lot of money and gets a lot of women easily.

## Course Structure
Feburary 19th - May 11th
Weeks. In COMP6900 We do metric weeks. That means a week starts on day 1 and ends on day 10. A 'month' has 10 weeks. A semester has 1.5 months.
So that means a semester is exactly 150 days. Given 365 days a year, we have 2 semesters and 2-3 'hyper' courses each semester. A lot of the time it is very chill and very cool. No tutorials but rather online based question-answers in forums and on demand video/voice sessions with the dictator or an AI.
